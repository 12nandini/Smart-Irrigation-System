# Smart-Irrigation-System
A smart irrigation system using sensors technology with Arduino to efficiently utilize water for irrigation purpose. The system has soil moisture sensor inserted into the soil of the plants, water will be pumped to plants for irrigation. An algorithm has been built out with set points of soil moisture sensor to control the water quantity in soil. This project requires Arduino board having inbuilt ATMega328 microchip. The micro-controller collects the input signals converted into values of moisture in the soil via soil moisture sensors. As the microcontroller starts obtaining the signals, it creates an output that forces a relay for running the water pumping motor. An LCD screen is also linked to the microcontroller to show moisture conditions of the soil and water pump.

ADVANTAGES:
1) Automation eliminates the manual operation of opening or closing valves. Possibility to change frequency of irrigation and fertigation processes and to optimize these processes.
2) Adoption of advanced crop systems and new technologies, especially new crop systems that are complex and difficult operate manually.
3) Use of water from different sources and increased efficiency in water and fertilizer use. â€¢System can be operated at night, water loss from evaporation is thus minimized.
4) Irrigation process starts and stops exactly when required, thus optimizing energy requirements
